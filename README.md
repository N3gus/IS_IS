# IS-IS Routing Protocol Simulator

A Python-based interactive simulator for the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol. This tool allows network engineers and students to understand and experiment with IS-IS routing concepts through a user-friendly interface.

## Project Description

The IS-IS Routing Protocol Simulator is an educational tool designed to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of IS-IS routing. It provides a simplified implementation of IS-IS routing mechanisms, allowing users to create network topologies, establish router relationships, and visualize routing decisions in real-time.

## Features

- üåê Interactive network topology creation
- üîÑ Support for Level 1 and Level 2 routers
- üìä Dynamic routing table calculation using Dijkstra's algorithm
- üîó Custom link cost configuration
- üìà Real-time network visualization
- üíª User-friendly command-line interface
- üó∫Ô∏è Routing table display and management

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NetworkX (for graph operations and visualization)
- Matplotlib (for network topology visualization)
- Type hints (for better code documentation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install required dependencies, i.e matplotlib.


## Usage

1. Start the simulator.
2. Use the interactive menu to:
   - Add routers to the network
   - Create links between routers
   - Calculate routes
   - View routing tables
   - Visualize the network topology

### Example Program Flow:
1. Add routers using option 1
2. Create links between routers using option 2
3. Calculate routes using option 3
4. View the routing tables using option 4
5. Visualize the network using option 5

## Programmatic Usage

### Create a new network
network = ISISNetwork()

### Add routers
network.add_router("R1", level=2)
network.add_router("R2", level=2)
network.add_router("R3", level=2)

### Add links
network.add_link("R1", "R2", cost=1)
network.add_link("R2", "R3", cost=1)

### Calculate routes
network.calculate_shortest_paths()

### Visualize the network
network.visualize_network()
